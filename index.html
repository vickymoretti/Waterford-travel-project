						<h2>Why Waterford?</h2>
						<h3>Ireland's oldest city</h3>
						<p>
							Founded in 914 AD by Vikings from Norway, Waterford City is over
							1100 years old making it Ireland’s oldest City. In 914,the great
							Viking adventurer and pirate, Regnall, established a base here and
							built a Longphort or ships haven, which would in time become a
							modern city. The City was captured by the Anglo Normans in 1170
							and the Vikings were expelled bringing a dramatic change. Within a
							few years of being captured, Waterford was escalated to the status
							of Royal City which owed allegiance to the Anglo Norman King of
							England, Henry II.
						</p>
						<p>
							Today, Waterford is a vibrant and picturesque city that has
							managed to carefully maintain its important heritage, while also
							having a lively and modern shopping area, filled with cafes, award
							winning restaurants and an excellent mix of traditional, local and
							contemporary pubs.</p
